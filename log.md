# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

OH my gosh. I thought i was so much better at programming... until I actually sat down to create this "page". Doesn't look like much because I spent most of my time researching.  It'll get better (and easier) as I continue this challenge!

Day 1 : January 5, 2017 (starting over)

Played around with my div on the project. Trying to center it. It's been a while, so all of this is a bit rough

Day 2 : January 6, 2017

Finally settled on a subject for my tribute page, added a few lines of text, a picture, and an unordered list. Spent some time refreshing myself on Bootstrap. I need to use that to really bring things together.

Day 3: January 7, 2017

Added a colored background and a little more text. "Centered" the image, although i'd like the code to be a little less clunky. Couldn't really figure out how to integrate Bootstrap, but I'll keep trying.
